Python-to-Java Dictionary Compiler
A programming language tool designed to seamlessly translate Python dictionary syntax into Java HashMap code.

Example
Our tool focuses on intuitive syntax and seamless integration:

python
Copy code
# Python-like syntax:
dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in dict:
    print(dict[key])

# Equivalent Java code after translation:
HashMap<String, Integer> dict = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
dict.put("a", 1);
dict.put("b", 2);
dict.put("c", 3);
for (String key : dict.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(dict.get(key));
}
Save to grepper
This Python-like code is translated to Java, maintaining readability and performance.

Features
Syntactic Ease: Write dictionary operations using Python's elegant syntax.
Java Integration: Seamlessly convert your Python-like code into robust Java code.
Control Flow: Translate Python control statements, like if and for, into their Java equivalents.
Error Handling: Informative error messages assist in debugging during the translation process.
Getting Started
To use the Python-to-Java Dictionary Compiler, follow these steps:

Write your code using the Python dictionary syntax.
Run the compiler to translate your code into Java.
Integrate the generated Java code into your application.
Future Scope
Support for additional Python features and data structures.
Enhanced error handling and optimization for large-scale applications.
Expansion to support a full subset of Python's functionality for a comprehensive development experience.
